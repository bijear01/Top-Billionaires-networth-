# LIMITATIONS
the networth value of billionaires in 2023  of this dataset seems not to be accurate and the amount of billionaires across the wold is more than 72 . 
the dataset is limited to 72 instead of 2640 billionaires which can not eventually give a real and up to date analysis led to wrong analysis
coming to the top 5 billionaires worldwide Elon Musk come first with 4490.8  instead of $258.2 billion.
